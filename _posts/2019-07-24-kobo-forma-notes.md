暂时不打算装koreader，看看原生系统有多少能折腾的。


## Custom Screen Saver

According to https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3868795

The steps needed to use a random image for the screensaver are:
1. In the ".kobo" directory, create a directory called "screensaver".
2. Put the images you want to see as screensavers in the new directory.
3. Disconnect the device.
4. In the settings, on the "Energy saving and privacy" screen, turn on "Show current read" and "Show book covers full screen".
5. Put the device to sleep and see one of the images. If there is only one image, it will always be used.

This came up in a discussion elsewhere that was sort of triggered by the current miniclock discussion. It has been in the firmware since 4.13.x without anyone noticing.
